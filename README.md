datainimage
===========

Javasciript code that saves ASCII characters as an image using the HTML5 Canvas object.

I was looking for a way to save serialized JSON data as an image for my TODO web app so I could theoretically save an image on Google+ and use it as my data store for my TODO web app. This is my research.
